## Features

**‚ö° Prompt-to-Code Next.js Apps**  
Transform natural language descriptions into complete Next.js applications with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. No templates, no restrictions.

**üéØ Unlimited Free AI Generation**  
Powered by Grok 4 during beta. Generate as many applications as you need without hitting usage limits or paywalls.

**‚ú® No AI Boilerplate**  
Clean, idiomatic Next.js code without generic AI patterns. Every generation feels intentional, structured, and ready for real-world projects.

**üåê Instant Live Preview**  
Every generation deploys automatically through e2b.app. Get a live demo URL instantly to test and share your application without configuration.

**üîÑ Iterative Development**  
Refine your application through conversational prompts. Add features, adjust layouts, or fix issues without rewriting from scratch.

---
## Current Limitations

**‚è±Ô∏è Extended Processing Time**  
Generation and deployment can take up to 10 minutes due to free-tier AI model limitations and background job processing through Inngest. Patience is appreciated.

**üîç Manual Review Required**  
AI-generated code should always be reviewed before production use. While Nextly produces clean code, human oversight ensures it meets your specific requirements and edge cases.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Occasional TypeScript Errors**  
Being in beta, generated code may contain TypeScript or Next.js compilation errors. Most are minor and easily fixable, but debugging skills are recommended.

**‚è∞ Preview Expires Quickly**  
Deployed previews go down after 10-30 minutes due to budget constraints. Download your code immediately if you need to keep it or deploy elsewhere.

**üö¶ Rate Limits Apply**  
Higher-than-average rate limits are in place, but still present. Heavy usage may trigger cooldown periods to maintain service stability for all users.

**üì¶ Best for Small to Medium Projects**  
Nextly excels at landing pages, portfolios, simple dashboards, and component libraries. Complex enterprise applications with intricate business logic, multi-step workflows, or extensive backend integration are not recommended. Keep projects focused and scoped appropriately.

## Example Prompts

<details>
<summary><strong>Landing Page</strong></summary>

Create a modern SaaS landing page for a project management tool. Include a hero section with a gradient background, headline "Manage Projects Effortlessly", subheadline, and two CTA buttons (Start Free Trial, Watch Demo). Add a features section with 6 feature cards in a grid layout, each with an icon, title, and description. Include a pricing section with 3 tiers (Starter $9/mo, Pro $29/mo, Enterprise custom) showing features as checkmarks. Add a testimonials carousel with 5 customer reviews including avatar, name, company, and quote. Footer should have 4 columns: Product links, Company links, Resources, and social media icons. Use a blue and white color scheme with smooth animations on scroll.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Portfolio</strong></summary>

Build a portfolio website for a frontend developer. Create a hero section with my name "Alex Chen", tagline "Frontend Developer & UI Designer", and a profile image on the right. Add a projects section displaying 6 projects in a masonry grid layout. Each project card should have a thumbnail image, project title, tech stack tags (React, TypeScript, etc.), short description, and buttons for Live Demo and GitHub. Include an about section with a two-column layout: left side has my bio paragraph, right side lists technical skills grouped by category (Frontend, Backend, Tools) with progress bars showing proficiency. Add a contact section with a working form (name, email, message fields) and my email and LinkedIn links. Use a dark theme with green accent colors.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Dashboard</strong></summary>

Generate an analytics dashboard for an e-commerce admin panel. Create a sidebar navigation on the left with menu items (Dashboard, Orders, Products, Customers, Analytics, Settings) with icons. The main content area should have 4 stat cards at the top showing Total Revenue, Orders Today, Active Users, and Conversion Rate with numbers and percentage changes (up/down arrows). Below that, add a 2-column layout: left side has a placeholder for a line chart showing revenue over time, right side shows recent orders table with columns (Order ID, Customer, Amount, Status). Status should have colored badges (Pending yellow, Completed green, Cancelled red). Add a top navbar with search bar, notifications bell icon, and user profile dropdown. Use a light gray background with purple accents.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Blog</strong></summary>

Create a tech blog with a clean, readable design. Homepage should have a large featured post at the top with cover image, category badge, title, excerpt, author info (avatar, name, date), and read time. Below that, display 9 blog posts in a 3-column grid with smaller cards (thumbnail, category, title, excerpt, author, date). Add a sidebar on the right with search bar, popular posts widget (5 posts with thumbnails and titles), categories list, and newsletter signup form. Individual blog post page should have full-width cover image, title, author info, reading progress bar at top, formatted content with headings, code blocks, and blockquotes, and related posts at the bottom. Include a comment section placeholder. Use a serif font for article content and sans-serif for UI elements.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Authentication</strong></summary>

Build complete authentication pages with modern design. Login page should have a centered card with logo at top, "Welcome Back" heading, email and password input fields with icons, "Remember Me" checkbox, "Forgot Password?" link, primary login button, divider with "or continue with", social login buttons (Google, GitHub, Twitter) with icons, and "Don't have an account? Sign up" link at bottom. Signup page similar layout but with Name, Email, Password, and Confirm Password fields. Add real-time password strength indicator showing Weak/Medium/Strong with colored bar. Include form validation with error messages below fields. Forgot password page should have email input and reset link button. Use gradient background with glassmorphism effect on the card.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>E-commerce Product Page</strong></summary>

Design a detailed product page for a sneaker store. Left side should have an image gallery with one large main image and 4 thumbnail images below that change the main image on click. Right side has product info: breadcrumb navigation, product name "Air Max 2024", star rating (4.5 stars with 230 reviews link), price with strikethrough original price showing discount, color selector with clickable color swatches, size selector with size buttons (US 7-13), stock status badge, quantity selector with plus/minus buttons, two CTA buttons (Add to Cart primary, Add to Wishlist secondary), and accordion sections for Description, Shipping Info, and Return Policy. Below the main section, add tabs for Reviews, Size Guide, and Product Details. At the bottom, show a "You May Also Like" section with 4 related product cards in a horizontal scroll. Use a modern, minimal design with black and white theme.
